      <h1>about</h1>
      <p><b>itâ€™s not a phase</b> is a collection of mono-screen prints reflecting on my life, depicting photographs of myself from childhood to now. Each photograph is hand printed with water-based pastels in colors that signify that memory or time in my life to me. All of the images are accompanied by multiple ghost prints, in which the colors meld and bleed into each other like memories do.</p>

These colors are the same used in the 'it's not a phase' bubble letters at the top of the page. The crayons are arranged in a row and each is tilted diagonally, with the tips facing up left.">
